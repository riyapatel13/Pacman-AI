Pac-Man Behavior:
	Normally, Pac-Man uses A* and path-finds to the closest food. During A*, the graph (grid) is set so that the cost to move into a food is 1, into an empty grid is 5-ish, the Moore’s Neighbors around ghosts are 50, and the Von Neumann Neighbors around ghosts are 99. This ensures that the Pac-Man, in its quest for vengeance, does not run into the ghost and prioritizes food over empty squares. When a ghost is scared, Pac-Man will path-find to the scared ghost instead of food.


Ghosts Behavior: 
	The ghosts were originally going to protect a single food so that the Pac-Man can never finish the game. However, once we started writing the code for the ghost, we realized that the ghosts are not allowed to turn around or stop around a place, so those ideas and the ideas were scrapped. Instead, we used A* and provided 4 different ghost behaviors:
	1. Follows Pac-Man and prefers to approach from behind (By setting the move cost in front of Pac-Man to be higher)
	2. Follows Pac-Man and prefers to approach from ahead (Which allows trapping behavior)
	3. Follows Pac-Man (No preference).
	4. Choose a random location on the board and path finds to it, but, set the moveCost (gCost) to a location to be the squared distance between the location and the Pac-Man’s location. This means the ghost would prefer to choose a path that leads it closer to Pac-Man.
Also, when the ghosts are scared they run away to the location furthest away from Pac-Man.
