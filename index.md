## Project Overview

As a final project in the Artificial Intelligence course at Stanford Univerity's Precollegiate Studies, my team and I created the most optimal Pacman and ghost agents (after much trial and error). The details of the implementations can be found below. This project was completed in collaboration with Ziz Cheng and Charles Sun.

After the completion of this project, I have also implemented various other Pacman agents with several approaches, including:
* Iterative Deepening
* Minimax and Expectimax
* SAT Solver and logic
* Graph planning
* Linear Programming and Integer Programming
* Branch-and-Bound
* MDPs and Value Iteration
* Q-learning
* Bayes' Nets
* Joint Particle Filter

These files are not contained in this Github repository, but feel free to reach out for more info on the other implementations.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/riyapatel13/Pacman-AI/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/riyapatel13/Pacman-AI/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
